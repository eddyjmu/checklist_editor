3. files
  index
  includes/
    models:
      home
      newlistpage
      editlistpage
      reportspage
      optionspage
    dependencies:
      form
      xml
    views:
      page
      checklistpage
      optionspagelayout
    controllers:
      menu
      listsaveform
      jquerymod
      loadform
  css/

  misc/
    images/
    js/
      jquerymod.js
4. each list item should have a unix timestamp attached so that the reporting page can keep an item-by-item record of item completion
5. options
  reporting only available if user would like it to be there or not?
    ajax into config file? (possible file/folder permissions issue for porting to other servers)
      read config file to know if page is even available in settings? or
      read the config file to know if link to page is hidden
6. checking off list items done via checkbox, obviously
7. jquery core files downloaded from source (for availability offline AKA my development environment) with note on why and link to source commented out
8. probably going to have to consolodate the new list and edit list pages.  i mean, there's no point in having two if the post information is going to have trouble translating WITH errors across multiple pages (or even worse, back tot he original page)
9. also, remove page titles from classes and keep them only in the settings class, since editing them in one place makes way more sense.
10. going to go completely db from here on in, since apparently the xml saver breaks on permissions rules in my own localhost.  The good news that i am surprisingly better in mysql than xml. oh and its way easier.
